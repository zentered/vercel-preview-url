Retrieve the preview URL from the Vercel API, filtered by the repo and branch. The URL can then be used for further end-to-end tests, link checks and other PR integrations/actions.

The main difference to [Capture Vercel Preview URL](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/capture-vercel-preview-url) is that the action runs on `push` and `pull_request`, not on `issue_comment`. This enables 3rd party GitHub integrations to report directly on the Pull Request.

## Usage

- See [Integration Test / Demo](https://github.com/PatrickHeneise/vercel-preview-action-test/blob/main/.github/workflows/integration.yml)

Vercel needs a little time to build the preview, you can check the average build time in your deployments and add the seconds plus a little to a `sleep` action, to wait until the deployment is `READY`.

Instead of an arbitrary time, the [Await for Vercel deployment](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/await-for-vercel-deployment) Action can be used.

```yaml
- run: sleep 30
- name: vercel-preview-url
  uses: zentered/vercel-preview-url@v1.1.9
  id: vercel_preview_url
  env:
    VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
  with:
    vercel_project_id: 'prj_XYZ123'
- name: Get URL
  run: echo "https://${{ steps.vercel_preview_url.outputs.preview_url }}"
```

### Vercel Project ID

Your project name is not the same as the project ID. You can find the project ID in the Project Settings, it starts with `prj_`:

## Environment Variables / Secret

In the repository, go to "Settings", then "Secrets" and add "VERCEL_TOKEN", the value you can retrieve on your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/account/tokens).

By optionally setting `SEARCH_BRANCH_NAME` as an environment variable, you can override the branch name used to search for deployments in Vercel.
This environment variable is useful in cases where GITHUB_REF becomes the default branch, such as when commenting on pull requests or adding labels.
